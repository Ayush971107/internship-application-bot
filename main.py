The opportunity to join your Data Management & Stewardship Summer Internship program excites me, as it offers the chance to contribute directly to critical transformation initiatives within a leading company. As a full-stack and data visualization internship at Humana, I utilized Angular for the frontend and the .NET framework for the backend to improve code quality metrics by 20% and engineered optimized SQL database solutions that increased processing speeds by 35% for high-volume datasets.
Beyond software development, I have a strong interest in deep learning and have completed multiple projects in this field. For instance, I developed an age prediction tool using TensorFlow and a ResNet-9 CNN model, achieving 85% accuracy in estimating ages from group photos. I also led the creation of FraudGuardPro, a system for detecting fraudulent insurance claims using decision trees and random forests with Scikit-learn. Participating in various hackathons and collaborating with diverse teams has honed my ability to thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to collaborate with seasoned professionals in a dynamic, growth-oriented environment. Builders FirstSourceâ€™s focus on continuous learning and innovation aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I am confident that my strong analytical skills, coupled with my dedication to data-driven decision-making, will allow me to be an asset to your team.
